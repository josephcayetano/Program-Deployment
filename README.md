# D602-Task-3-Program-Deployment
### Overview
This project focuses on deploying a machine learning model for flight delay prediction through API development and containerization, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### API Development & Containerization â€“ FastAPI & Docker
-	Deployed the trained model as a REST API using FastAPI, implementing two endpoints for health checks and real-time flight delay prediction based on airport and schedule inputs.
-	Wrote comprehensive unit tests (pytest) for both valid and invalid requests; ensured robustness and error handling with custom HTTP responses.
-	Containerized the API with a custom Dockerfile, exposing the service on port 8000 for scalable deployment; documented and resolved challenges around Conda vs. virtual environments and exception handling.
